# Hey Dude 

**This is an offer to repositories that are written a Chinese language.**

Basicly this script checks the trend repos and it will open a issue to the chinese language repos about the English translation. Please check the [issue_body.md](https://github.com/us/hey-dude/blob/master/issue_body.md) to issue context.

We want to say just one thing:

### Our Problem about Chinese README

Firstly we congratulate you for getting so much star by sharing this repository with humanity.

We're always disappointing when we couldn't understand a trending repository and we think we are not alone about that. 

When we see this article, our minds are blurring like that Gollum.

### What we want:
 - Add English translation to sharing knowledge to more people.
