# Hey Dude 

**This is an offer to repositories that are written a Chinese language.**

In the beautiful mornings most people be disappointed when they see too many Chinese repos on the github trendings. There are a limited number of trend repos and it is not possible to read close to half of them. That thing upset most developer and cost bad mornings.

This script checks the trend repos and it will open a issue to the Chinese language repos about the English translation. 

_[issue_body.md](https://github.com/us/hey-dude/blob/master/issue_body.md) is a issue context._

_[created_repo_issues.md](https://github.com/us/hey-dude/blob/master/created_repo_issues.md) contains opened repos issues._

**Note :** If you see any Chinese repos, you can use `issue_body.md` context to open an issue to Chinese repos.

We want to say just one thing:

### Our Problem about Chinese README

Firstly we congratulate you for getting so much star by sharing this repository with humanity.

We're always disappointing when we couldn't understand a trending repository and we think we are not alone about that. 

When we see these repo on trending, our minds are blurring like that Gollum.

**Maybe** you will want to help us, there are a lot of people who want to know this beautiful source but can't read.

### What we want:
 - Add English translation to sharing knowledge to more people.

### What our promise:
 - More feedback to improve project.
 - New ideas about your project.
 - Great fame.
